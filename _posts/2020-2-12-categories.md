Couple of items. 

1. I've added Categories to the site. I don't think you need to be told what they do or how they work. 
2. Systems are fun, even if they're physical.

## 1 Categories
So I did a little googling and came across this [Blog Post](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/creating-category-pages-in-jekyll-without-plugins) on how to create categories in jekyll. Jekyll is a lot of fun, there is something scrappy about building a site using a system like jekyll that I just enjoy. Every time I hack away at this little blog I feel like I'm subverting the norm when it comes to site building. It's fun! 

## 2 Physical Systems
I found an old gridded journal recently, with very little content in it. It got me thinking about [Bullet Journal](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal). I'll assume you clicked the link, and read the FAQ. I feel like I've been doing this already with the whiteboard I have in my office, I figure, why not try taking it with me too. I'll probably bungle it up like I do this site, but that's all part of the act of _doing_ isn't it? In a lot of ways I feel like jekyll and bullet journal aim for the same target: provide a flexable system, that is uncomplicated, and doesn't stand in your way. 

Though I've only just started toying around with the idea of using that notebook to organize my time, I can see it working. 

I put down that I would get some "coding" done tonight, and this is the result.
