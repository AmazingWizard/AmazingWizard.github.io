**If you're in my DND game, you probably shouldn't read this**

> If you spend enough time inside the city, you will inevitably hear a story about Marcus Moor. Some will tell you Marcus is a menace to society, a usurper of the law, and an agent of chaos. Others will tell you that Marcus is a ray of hope cutting through the fog of injustice that lays across the city. Those who have been saved by Marcus’s hand feel indebted, and often take up the name Marcus Moor as their own, as a way to show solidarity with Marcus’s cause and to shield Marcus from persecution. How could the Twelve arrest Marcus Moor, if they’re not even sure they have the original Marcus Moor in custody?

> Those stories you’ve heard about Marcus Moor all have one thing in common, none of the storytellers can agree on what Marcus Moor looks like. in some stories, Marcus Moor is a young woman, others an old man. Marcus Moor is tall, short, fat, handsome, ugly, or beautiful. So just who is Marcus Moor? The Knights of the Twelve wish to find out, the citizens Marcus has helped need not care, and to me well…I’m a bit biased, because I am Marcus Moor. 

Marcus Moor is a character/faction in my game of DND. My players have yet to encounter Marcus, and I'm anticipating when they do. I've created a stat block, which acts as a template, that can be applied to any other statblock to create a Marcus Moor NPC.

The concept is that in Combat you would have many NPCs with the Marcus Moor actions attached to them. They would have their normal actions per their statblock -- Assassins would have Sneak Attack, Apprentice Wizards would still have spell casting -- but they would also have these abilities. You can use the Marcus Moor skills to ensure all the NPCs get a chance to stand and fight the party, and when they get damaged, swap them with a healthy NPC. You want to play up the mystery surrounding Marcus Moor. Is Marcus a shapeshifter? Could Marcus be some kind of god walking among us? Who can say! 

The other thing to remember too though, is that Marcus Moor is a **faction**. Play them like one! As a collective they have goals, and as individuals they have their own unique goals. In my world, if your story is worthy of song and stage, you could find yourself in an Audition with the Actors on the Grand Stage, and by that I mean, you could find yourself assending to Godhood. That's kinda where Marcus Moor is at, and where the followers get these abilitys from. 

Later, ✌️
