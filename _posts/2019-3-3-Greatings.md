Hey, I'm Tom. I do IT Work in the EDU space, im super keen on coding and programing, knee deep into the hobby that is D&D, and getting my feet wet with 3D Printing. You can find a mix of all those things here in my small corner of the internet.

You might show up to the site and find it a totall shit show, thats my fault, I can't stop tinkering with it, and I do it live -- mostly because I expect no one to be reading this anyway. If you are trying to read the site, and its borked, then sorry! Book mark it, and check it later. 

Also, I'll note, spelling is optional here. I'm writing these posts and pages inside VS Code far away from my Grammerly extension that takes my addled brain's idea of WORDS and SPELLING and turns them into passable english language. 

I'll do my best to dump the contents of a blog post into a google doc to spare you the mind horror that is my ability to spell words good, but I make no promises or guarantees. 

Later, 
✌️
